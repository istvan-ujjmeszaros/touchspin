# CI Workflow Optimization Notes

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Playwright Installation Optimization** ‚ö°
**Problem:** Playwright installation taking 2+ minutes every run
**Solution:**
- Split browser installation from system dependencies
- Only install browser binary when cache miss occurs (line 63-65)
- System deps always installed (required even with cached browsers)
- Version-specific cache key prevents stale browser caches

### 2. **Enhanced Caching Strategy** üì¶

#### a) Yarn Dependencies Cache
- Caches `.yarn/cache`, `.yarn/unplugged`, and `.yarn/install-state.gz`
- Uses hash of `yarn.lock` + `.yarnrc.yml` for precise cache invalidation
- Built-in Node.js action cache support added (line 22)

#### b) Playwright Browser Cache
- Version-specific cache key using actual Playwright version (lines 44-46)
- Conditional installation only when cache miss (line 64)
- Fallback restore keys for partial matches

#### c) Build Artifacts Cache
- Caches compiled `dist` directories (lines 72-80)
- Invalidates on source code or config changes
- Reduces build time when source unchanged

### 3. **Performance Optimizations** üöÄ

- **Reduced Playwright install time:** From 2+ minutes to ~15 seconds (when cached)
- **Skip redundant browser downloads:** Only downloads when version changes
- **Yarn cache:** Faster dependency resolution with PnP cache
- **Build cache:** Skip rebuilding unchanged packages

### 4. **Best Practices Applied** ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ Use `actions/checkout@v4` (latest version)
- ‚úÖ Node.js built-in cache support enabled
- ‚úÖ Proper cache key strategies with fallbacks
- ‚úÖ Conditional steps to avoid redundant work
- ‚úÖ Unique artifact names to prevent collisions (line 97)
- ‚úÖ `if-no-files-found: ignore` prevents failures on missing reports
- ‚úÖ Success condition on tarball validation (line 89)

### 5. **Estimated Time Savings** ‚è±Ô∏è

| Step | Before | After (cached) | Savings |
|------|--------|---------------|----------|
| Yarn install | ~30s | ~10s | 20s |
| Playwright install | 2+ min | ~15s | 1m 45s |
| Build packages | ~45s | ~10s (if cached) | 35s |
| **Total** | **~3m 15s** | **~35s** | **~2m 40s** |

### 6. **Additional Optimizations to Consider**

1. **Parallel Jobs**: Split linting, testing, and building into parallel jobs
2. **Matrix Testing**: Test multiple Node versions in parallel
3. **Conditional Workflows**: Skip CI on docs-only changes
4. **Docker Cache**: Use container with pre-installed dependencies
5. **Self-hosted Runners**: For consistent performance and pre-warmed caches

## Cache Invalidation Strategy

1. **Yarn cache**: Invalidates when `yarn.lock` or `.yarnrc.yml` changes
2. **Playwright cache**: Invalidates when Playwright version changes
3. **Build cache**: Invalidates when source files or build configs change

## Monitoring Recommendations

- Track cache hit rates in GitHub Actions insights
- Monitor workflow run times over time
- Set up alerts for workflows exceeding expected duration
- Regular cache cleanup for storage optimization

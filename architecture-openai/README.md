# Architecture (OpenAI Analyses)

This folder contains machine‑generated architecture notes to help compare the legacy jQuery plugin in `src/` with the modern modular implementation in `packages/`.

Contents
- `methods-diff.md` — Side‑by‑side method inventory, pseudo‑code, and behavioral diffs.
- `architecture.json` — Machine‑readable model of modules, APIs, events, and relationships.
- `diagrams/` — Mermaid diagrams (multiple views kept as separate files).

Notes
- Source of truth remains the code. These notes are for review and should be kept in sync with code changes when APIs/behavior change.

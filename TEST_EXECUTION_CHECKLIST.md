# Bootstrap TouchSpin Test Execution Checklist

This document tracks the execution status of all tests in the Bootstrap TouchSpin test suite. Mark test files as passing when all individual tests within them pass, or failing if any test fails.

## How to Update This Checklist

### 1. Run All Tests
```bash
# Run tests with list reporter for detailed output
npx playwright test --reporter=list

# Or run with JSON reporter for programmatic parsing
npx playwright test --reporter=json > tmp/test-results.json
```

### 2. Parse Test Results
Use the dedicated parsing script to extract and format test results:

```bash
# Method 1: Save results to file, then parse
npx playwright test --reporter=json > tmp/test-results.json
node scripts/parse-test-results.js tmp/test-results.json

# Method 2: Pipe results directly (faster)
npx playwright test --reporter=json | node scripts/parse-test-results.js
```

The script will output:
- **Overview counters** to update the summary section
- **File status markers** showing which files pass/fail
- **Individual test results** for detailed checkbox updates

### 3. Update Checklist Manually
- Mark test files as `[x]` if ALL tests in the file pass
- Mark test files as `[ ]` if ANY test in the file fails  
- Mark individual tests: `[x]` for pass, `[-]` for fail, `[~]` for flaky
- Update the overview counters in the Test Suite Overview section
- Add the generated history log entry to the Test Execution History section

### 4. Single File Testing (Recommended for Development)
For faster feedback cycles when fixing specific issues:

```bash
# Test a single file and parse results
npx playwright test __tests__/basicOperations.test.ts --reporter=json > tmp/test-results.json
node scripts/parse-test-results.js tmp/test-results.json

# Or use the pipe method for single files
npx playwright test __tests__/basicOperations.test.ts --reporter=json | node scripts/parse-test-results.js
```

This approach allows you to:
- Quickly verify fixes without waiting for the full suite
- Update specific sections of the checklist incrementally
- Track progress on problematic test files

## Test Suite Overview

## Usage Instructions

1. **For Test Files**: Mark `[x]` if ALL individual tests in the file pass, `[ ]` if ANY test fails
2. **For Individual Tests**: Mark `[x]` if passes, `[-]` if fails, `[~]` if flaky
3. **Update Counters**: Update the overview section with current pass/fail counts
4. **Update History Log**: Add new entries to the Test Execution History section
5. **Test Execution**: Use `scripts/parse-test-results.js` to generate formatted updates
6. **Single File Testing**: Test individual files for faster development cycles

## Notes

- This checklist covers the complete test suite as of the current codebase state
- Tests should be run against the modern architecture implementation
- Visual tests require screenshot comparison and may need baseline updates
- Some tests may be environment-specific (browser, viewport, etc.)
- Use `[x]` for passing tests, `[-]` for failing tests, `[~]` for flaky tests

## Test Execution History

Track test execution progress over time. Add new entries at the top.

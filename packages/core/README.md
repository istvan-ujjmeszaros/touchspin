@touchspin/core (Placeholder)
================================

Status: scaffold only. This will host the frameworkâ€‘agnostic core that powers all wrappers. Not published yet.

Goals:
- No jQuery dependency; ESM first.
- Clean lifecycle API: init/destroy/update, spin controls, value pipeline, ARIA sync.
- Works with renderer packages via a small interface.

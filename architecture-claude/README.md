# Bootstrap TouchSpin Architecture Analysis

This folder contains a comprehensive analysis comparing the original monolithic architecture (src/) with the new modular architecture (packages/).

## Structure

### `/analysis/`
- **`method-comparison.md`** - Detailed three-stage evolution comparison (Legacy → In-Between → New)
- **`architecture-model.json`** - Complete data model of all three architectures with dependencies

### `/diagrams/`  
- **`class-structure.mmd`** - Class diagrams showing structural differences
- **`component-overview.mmd`** - Component relationships and module boundaries
- **`sequence-flows.mmd`** - Interaction sequences and event handling
- **`data-flow.mmd`** - Data and event flow patterns

### `/pseudo-code/`
- **`original-methods.md`** - Pseudo-code representation of original implementation
- **`new-methods.md`** - Pseudo-code representation of new modular implementation

## Purpose

1. **Three-stage evolution tracking** to understand the complete architectural transformation
2. **Method-level comparison** to identify functionality changes, improvements, and patterns
3. **Architecture visualization** to understand structural differences across all stages  
4. **Documentation** for understanding the modernization journey and future development

## Navigation

Start with `analysis/method-comparison.md` for the detailed comparison, then refer to the diagrams for visual understanding of the architectural changes.

# Bootstrap TouchSpin Architecture Analysis

This folder contains a comprehensive analysis comparing the original monolithic architecture (src/) with the new modular architecture (packages/).

## Structure

### `/analysis/`
- **`method-comparison.md`** - Detailed method-by-method comparison between versions
- **`architecture-model.json`** - Complete data model of both architectures with dependencies
- **`coverage-analysis.md`** - Test coverage comparison and gap analysis

### `/diagrams/`  
- **`class-structure.mmd`** - Class diagrams showing structural differences
- **`component-overview.mmd`** - Component relationships and module boundaries
- **`sequence-flows.mmd`** - Interaction sequences and event handling
- **`data-flow.mmd`** - Data and event flow patterns

### `/pseudo-code/`
- **`original-methods.md`** - Pseudo-code representation of original implementation
- **`new-methods.md`** - Pseudo-code representation of new modular implementation

## Purpose

1. **Method-level comparison** to identify functionality changes, improvements, or gaps
2. **Architecture visualization** to understand structural differences
3. **Coverage analysis** to ensure feature parity and identify missing test coverage
4. **Documentation** for future development and maintenance

## Navigation

Start with `analysis/method-comparison.md` for the detailed comparison, then refer to the diagrams for visual understanding of the architectural changes.
